knob for the female end of a hose for tool free connections

What:

	A parametric model of a knob for tool free hose connections.
	This adds "fingers" to the female end of the hose so you can exert
	a large force on the connector without using tools.
	
	

Status:
	Hex and Octo versions printed, and seem to work well.  Still messing with them, round version not finished yet
